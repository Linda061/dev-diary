## About Me
 Hi, My name is Linda Hashash. I'm working on this project to develop my skills while learning full stack programming.

 ## What I discovered regarding Markdown
 I gained knowledge about formatting content using code blocks, lists, links, bold, italics, and headings.

 ## My newfound knowledge of the command line
 Basic terminal commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `mkdir` were among the things I practiced.
 ### 📁 mkdir command
